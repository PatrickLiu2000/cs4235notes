# Cybersecurity Management
- organizational context for cybersec
- technical controls are used to reduce risk of attack on assets
    - what assets need to be secured?
## Organizational Context
- primary driver for cybersec - legal/compliance reasons
    - like financial/health data
- what technical controls to use?
    - understand threats
    - costs/benefits of security measures
## Key Challenges
- What are the threats and how serious is the risk posed by them?
    - probability of successful attack and its impact
- What technological solutions/controls exist to counter threats?
- How can we address risk in a cost-effective manner?
- how do we understand human behavior in the context of security?
## Security Planning
- what needs to be secured/how should we secure it
- who is responsible for it
- if something goes wrong
    - response/recovery, accountability
### Assets/Threats
- hardware, software, services (DBs, laptops, network)
- from who? (insiders/hackers)

### Security Planning: Controls
- identity/access management (IAM)
    - Credentialing, account creation and deletion
    - Password policies
- network/host defenses
    - firewalls, IDS/IPS
    - antivirus
- VPN and BYOD (bring your own device)
- Vulnerability patching
- User awareness and education (phishing)
### Security Planning: Security Policy
- high level declaration of security goals
    - Legal, business or regulatory rationale
    - do's and don'ts for users
    - Address prevention, detection, response
## GT Computer/Network Use Policies
- guiding goals
    - protect IT resources, no federal/state laws violated
- who's responsible - OIT for network, devices is individual

## Cyber Risk Assessment
- Investments in cyber security are driven by risk and how certain controls may reduce it
- some risk always will be there
- how do we assess it?
    - `Risk exposure = Probability [Adverse security event] * Cost Impact [ adverse event]`
- `Risk leverage = Risk exposure before - risk exposure after / cost of control`
- Risk leverage > 1 for the control to make sense
- Assessing impact - Expected loss (reputational,recovery and response, legal, loss of business etc.)
- Risk management
    - choices: accept risk, transfer risk, reduce risk
    - reduction via various methods

## Enterprise Cyber Security Postures
- reactive
    - respond to breach
    - analyze customer demands, regulation/compliance with laws
- proactive
    - have board member push for cybersecurity
- economic value
    - return on investment
    - Estimating costs and benefits is tricky
        - Perception vs. data-driven risk
